## [Unreleased]

### Added
- **A2A Protocol Cancel Method Implementation**
  - Complete implementation of `AgentExecutor.cancel()` method for A2A Protocol
  - Task ID extraction with priority: `task_id` > `context_id` > `metadata.task_id` > `metadata.context_id`
  - Support for custom error messages via `metadata.error_message`
  - Graceful cancellation by calling executor's `cancel()` method if supported
  - Token usage and partial results preservation during cancellation
  - Proper `TaskStatusUpdateEvent` generation with A2A Protocol compliance
  - Comprehensive error handling for task not found, already completed, and exception scenarios
  - Complete test coverage with 13 test cases covering all scenarios
  - Documentation updates in HTTP API and Python API references

- **Enhanced Task Copy Functionality**
  - `children` parameter for `create_task_copy()`: When `True`, also copy each direct child task with its dependencies
  - Deduplication ensures tasks depending on multiple copied tasks are only copied once
  - `children` parameter for `tasks.copy` API endpoint
  - `--children` flag for CLI `tasks copy` command

- **Copy Before Execution**
  - `copy_execution` parameter for `tasks.execute` API: Copy task before execution to preserve original task history
  - `copy_children` parameter: When `True` with `copy_execution=True`, also copy each direct child task with its dependencies
  - Response includes both `task_id` (copied task) and `original_task_id` (original task) when `copy_execution=True`
  - Combines `tasks.copy` and `tasks.execute` into a single API call for better user experience

- **Enhanced Task Deletion with Validation**
  - Physical deletion: Tasks are now physically removed from the database (not soft-deleted)
  - Conditional deletion: Tasks can only be deleted if all tasks (task itself + all children) are in `pending` status
  - Recursive child deletion: When deletion is allowed, all child tasks (including grandchildren) are automatically deleted
  - Dependency validation: Deletion is prevented if other tasks depend on the task being deleted
  - Detailed error messages: Returns specific error information when deletion fails:
    - Lists non-pending children with their statuses
    - Lists tasks that depend on the task being deleted
    - Indicates if the task itself is not pending
  - New TaskRepository methods:
    - `get_all_children_recursive()`: Recursively get all child tasks
    - `find_dependent_tasks()`: Find all tasks that depend on a given task (reverse dependencies)
    - `delete_task()`: Physically delete a task from the database
  - Comprehensive test coverage with 16 test cases covering all scenarios

- **Enhanced Task Update with Critical Field Validation**
  - Critical field protection: Three critical fields (`parent_id`, `user_id`, `dependencies`) are now strictly validated to prevent fatal errors
  - `parent_id` and `user_id`: Always rejected - these fields cannot be modified after task creation (task hierarchy and ownership are fixed)
  - `dependencies`: Conditional validation with four critical checks:
    1. Status check: Can only be updated when task is in `pending` status
    2. Reference validation: All dependency references must exist in the same task tree
    3. Circular dependency detection: Uses DFS algorithm to detect and prevent circular dependencies
    4. Execution check: Prevents updates if any dependent tasks are currently executing
  - Other fields: Can be updated freely without status restrictions (inputs, name, priority, params, schemas, status, result, error, progress, timestamps)
  - Comprehensive error reporting: All validation errors are collected and returned in a single response
  - New TaskRepository methods:
    - `update_task_dependencies()`: Update task dependencies with validation
    - `update_task_name()`: Update task name
    - `update_task_priority()`: Update task priority
    - `update_task_params()`: Update executor parameters
    - `update_task_schemas()`: Update validation schemas
  - New utility module: `dependency_validator.py` with reusable validation functions
  - Comprehensive test coverage with 23 test cases covering all validation scenarios


## [0.3.0] - 2025-11-30

### Added

  - Update types: `task_start`, `progress`, `task_completed`, `task_failed`, `final`
  - Comprehensive test coverage for webhook functionality

- **Protocol Identification**
  - Added `protocol` field to all API responses to distinguish between execution modes
    - JSON-RPC endpoints return `"protocol": "jsonrpc"` in response
    - A2A Protocol endpoints include `"protocol": "a2a"` in metadata and event data
  - Enables clients to identify which protocol was used for task execution
  - Consistent protocol identification across streaming updates and webhook callbacks

- **Streaming Mode for JSON-RPC**
  - Streaming mode support for `tasks.execute` endpoint via `use_streaming` parameter
  - Real-time progress updates via Server-Sent Events (SSE) - returns `StreamingResponse` directly when `use_streaming=true`
  - `TaskStreamingContext` class for in-memory event storage
  - Consistent behavior with A2A Protocol streaming mode
  - Asynchronous task execution with immediate response

- **Examples Module**
  - New `examples` module for initializing example task data to help beginners get started
  - CLI command `examples init` for initializing example tasks in the database
  - `--force` flag to re-initialize examples even if they already exist
  - Example tasks demonstrate various features:
    - Tasks with different statuses (completed, failed, pending, in_progress)
    - Task trees with parent-child relationships
    - Tasks with different priorities
    - Tasks with dependencies
    - CrewAI task example (requires LLM key)
  - Auto-initialization: API server automatically initializes examples if database is empty on startup
  - Example user ID: `example_user` for demo tasks

- **LLM API Key Management**
  - Request header support: `X-LLM-API-KEY` header for demo/one-time usage
    - Simple format: `X-LLM-API-KEY: <api-key>` (provider auto-detected from model name)
    - Provider-specific format: `X-LLM-API-KEY: <provider>:<api-key>` (e.g., `openai:sk-xxx`, `anthropic:sk-ant-xxx`)
  - User configuration support via `llm-key-config` extension for multi-user scenarios
    - In-memory storage of user-specific LLM keys (never stored in database)

### Changed
- **Unified Task Execution Architecture**
  - Refactored task execution logic to unify behavior across A2A Protocol and JSON-RPC endpoints
  - Added `TaskExecutor.execute_task_by_id()` method for executing tasks by ID with automatic dependency handling
  - Moved dependency collection and subtree building logic from protocol handlers to core `TaskExecutor` layer
  - Unified execution modes:
    - **Root task execution**: Executes the entire task tree when a root task is specified
    - **Child task execution**: Automatically collects all dependencies (including transitive) and executes the task with required dependencies
  - Both A2A Protocol and JSON-RPC now use the same core execution methods for consistent behavior
  - Protocol handlers are now thin wrappers around core execution logic, making the system more library-friendly
  - Improved code reusability and maintainability by centralizing execution logic in `TaskExecutor`

- **Task Re-execution Support**
  - Added support for re-executing failed tasks via `tasks.execute` endpoint
  - Failed tasks can now be re-executed by calling `tasks.execute` with the failed task's ID
  - When re-executing a task, all its dependency tasks are also re-executed (even if they are completed) to ensure consistency
  - Only `pending` and `failed` status tasks are executed; `completed` and `in_progress` tasks are skipped unless marked for re-execution
  - Dependency satisfaction logic updated to allow completed tasks marked for re-execution to satisfy dependencies (results are available)
  - Newly created tasks (status: `pending`) are not marked for re-execution and execute normally

- **Task Execution Order Clarification**
  - **Important**: Parent-child relationships (`parent_id`) are now explicitly documented as **organizational only** and do NOT affect execution order
  - **Only dependencies (`dependencies`) determine execution order** - a task executes when its dependencies are satisfied
  - This clarification ensures developers understand that task tree structure (parent-child) is separate from execution order (dependencies)
  - Updated all documentation to clearly distinguish between organizational relationships and execution dependencies

- **CLI Command Improvements**
  - `serve` command now accepts options directly (e.g., `apflow serve --port 8000`) without requiring `start` subcommand
  - `serve start` subcommand still works for backward compatibility
  - Improved command structure and user experience

- **CORS Support**
  - Added CORS middleware to API server for cross-origin requests
  - Default configuration allows `localhost:3000`, `localhost:3001` and common development ports
  - Configurable via `AIPARTNERUPFLOW_CORS_ORIGINS` environment variable (comma-separated list)
  - Development mode: `AIPARTNERUPFLOW_CORS_ALLOW_ALL=true` to allow all origins
  - Supports credentials, all HTTP methods, and all headers

- **API Architecture Refactoring**
  - Moved documentation routes (`/docs`, `/openapi.json`) to `api/routes/docs.py` for better code organization
  - Consolidated OpenAPI schema generation logic into `DocsRoutes` class
  - Improved separation of concerns: route handlers in `api/routes/`, documentation tools in `api/docs/`
  - All custom routes (tasks, system, docs) are now defined in a unified structure

- **SSE Streaming Simplification**
  - SSE streaming is now handled directly by `tasks.execute` with `use_streaming=true`
  - When `use_streaming=true`, `tasks.execute` returns a `StreamingResponse` with Server-Sent Events
  - Simplified API design: one endpoint (`tasks.execute`) handles both regular POST and SSE streaming modes
  - Webhook callbacks remain independent and can be used with either response mode

### Fixed
- **Test Infrastructure**
  - Consolidated database session management in `conftest.py` with global `use_test_db_session` fixture
  - All tests now use isolated in-memory DuckDB databases to prevent data pollution
  - Removed dependency on persistent database files for testing
  - Improved test isolation and reliability
  - Fixed `test_webhook_config_validation` test by using `patch.object()` for TaskTracker singleton
  - Updated `test_jsonrpc_tasks_execute_with_streaming` to correctly parse SSE stream responses
  - Added comprehensive test coverage for documentation routes (`/docs` and `/openapi.json`) with 14 test cases

- **Documentation Corrections**
  - Fixed incorrect command examples in README.md and docs:
    - Corrected `run my_batch` to proper `run flow --tasks` or `run flow executor_id` format
    - Corrected `run flow example_flow` to proper executor ID format
    - Removed non-existent `list-flows` command from documentation
  - Ensured all command examples in documentation are accurate and testable
  - Updated SSE streaming documentation to reflect direct integration with `tasks.execute`
