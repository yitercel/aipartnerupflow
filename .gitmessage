# <footer>

# Type must be one of the following:
#   feat:     A new feature
#   fix:      A bug fix
#   docs:     Documentation only changes
#   style:    Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code
#   refactor: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
#   perf:     A code change that improves performance
#   test:     Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests
#   chore:    Changes to the build process or auxiliary tools
#   ci:       Changes to CI configuration files and scripts

# Scope is optional and can be anything specifying the place of the commit change.
# Examples: api, core, storage, cli, stdio, etc.

# Subject should be:
#   - Use imperative, present tense: "change" not "changed" nor "changes"
#   - Don't capitalize first letter
#   - No dot (.) at the end
#   - Maximum 72 characters

# Body should include:
#   - Motivation for the change and contrast with previous behavior
#   - What changed and why
#   - Any breaking changes

# Footer should contain:
#   - Breaking changes (start with BREAKING CHANGE:)
#   - Issue references (Closes #123, Fixes #456)

# Examples:
#   feat(stdio): add stdio executor for process execution
#
#   Implement a new stdio executor that allows executing system commands
#   and processes via stdin/stdout communication, similar to MCP stdio
#   transport mode. This enables flexible task execution through shell
#   commands and Python scripts.
#
#   - Add StdioExecutor class with command execution support
#   - Add system resource monitoring (CPU, memory, disk)
#   - Support async process communication
#   - Add comprehensive error handling and logging
#
#   Closes #123

#   refactor(core): extract shared types to core.types module
#
#   Move common type definitions from various modules to a centralized
#   core.types module to avoid circular dependencies and improve code
#   organization.
#
#   - Add TaskPreHook and TaskPostHook type aliases
#   - Move TaskStatus enum to core.types
#   - Update imports across affected modules
