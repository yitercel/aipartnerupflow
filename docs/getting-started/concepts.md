# Core Concepts

Understanding these core concepts will help you use aipartnerupflow effectively. Don't worry - we'll explain everything in simple terms!

## Why These Concepts Matter

Before diving into the technical details, let's understand why these concepts exist and what problems they solve:

**The Problem**: When building applications, you often need to coordinate multiple operations that depend on each other. For example:
- Fetch data from an API, then process it, then save it
- Run multiple tasks in parallel, but wait for all to complete before proceeding
- Handle failures gracefully and retry automatically
- Track progress and state across long-running operations

**Without a framework**, you'd write custom code to:
- Manually coordinate task execution order
- Handle dependencies and wait conditions
- Implement retry logic and error recovery
- Track state and progress
- Manage different execution methods (HTTP, SSH, Docker, etc.)

**With aipartnerupflow**, these concepts provide a unified way to solve all these problems. The framework handles the complexity, so you can focus on your business logic.

Now let's learn the core concepts that make this possible!

## What is a Task?

A **task** is a unit of work that needs to be executed. Think of it like a function call, but with additional features like status tracking, dependencies, and persistence.

### Real-World Analogy

Imagine you're cooking dinner:
- **Task**: "Cook pasta"
- **Inputs**: Pasta, water, salt
- **Result**: Cooked pasta
- **Status**: pending → in_progress → completed

### In Code

```python
task = await task_repository.create_task(
    name="cook_pasta",           # What to do
    inputs={"pasta": "spaghetti", "water": "2L"},  # What you need
    user_id="chef123"            # Who's doing it
)
```

## What is Task Orchestration?

**Task orchestration** is the process of managing multiple tasks - deciding when they run, in what order, and how they relate to each other.

### Real-World Analogy

Think of a restaurant kitchen:
- The **chef** (TaskManager) coordinates everything
- Some dishes must be prepared in order (dependencies)
- Some can be prepared simultaneously (parallel tasks)
- The chef ensures everything is ready at the right time

### Why It Matters

Without orchestration, you'd have to manually manage:
- ✅ Which tasks to run
- ✅ When to run them
- ✅ What happens if one fails
- ✅ How to track progress

With aipartnerupflow, the **TaskManager** handles all of this automatically!

## What is a Task Tree?

A **task tree** is a hierarchical structure that organizes related tasks. It's like a family tree for your tasks.

### Visual Example

```
Root Task: "Prepare Dinner"
│
├── Task 1: "Buy Ingredients"
│   └── Task 1.1: "Go to Store"
│
├── Task 2: "Cook Main Course"
│   ├── Task 2.1: "Cook Pasta"
│   └── Task 2.2: "Make Sauce"
│
└── Task 3: "Set Table"
```

### Key Points

- **Parent-Child Relationship**: Used for organization only (like folders)
- **Dependencies**: Control execution order (Task 2 waits for Task 1)
- **Root Task**: The top-level task that contains everything

### In Code

```python
# Create root task
root = await task_repository.create_task(name="prepare_dinner", ...)

# Create child tasks
buy_ingredients = await task_repository.create_task(
    name="buy_ingredients",
    parent_id=root.id,  # Child of root
    ...
)

# Build tree
tree = TaskTreeNode(root)
tree.add_child(TaskTreeNode(buy_ingredients))
```

## What are Dependencies?

**Dependencies** define relationships between tasks. A task with dependencies will wait for those tasks to complete before executing.

### Real-World Analogy

You can't serve dinner until:
1. ✅ Ingredients are bought (Task 1)
2. ✅ Food is cooked (Task 2)
3. ✅ Table is set (Task 3)

Task 4 (Serve Dinner) **depends on** Tasks 1, 2, and 3.

### Visual Example

```
Task A: "Fetch Data"
  │
  └──> Task B: "Process Data" (depends on A)
         │
         └──> Task C: "Save Results" (depends on B)
```

**Execution Order**: A → B → C (automatic!)

### In Code

```python
# Task B depends on Task A
task_b = await task_repository.create_task(
    name="process_data",
    dependencies=[
        {"id": task_a.id, "required": True}  # Must wait for A
    ],
    ...
)
```

### Important Distinction

- **Parent-Child**: Organizational (like folders) - doesn't affect execution
- **Dependencies**: Execution control - determines when tasks run

```python
# Task B is a child of Task A (organization)
# But Task B depends on Task C (execution order)
task_b = await task_repository.create_task(
    parent_id=task_a.id,  # Organizational: B is child of A
    dependencies=[{"id": task_c.id}],  # Execution: B waits for C
    ...
)
```

## What are Executors?

An **executor** is the code that actually runs a task. It's like a worker that knows how to do a specific job.

### Types of Executors

1. **Built-in Executors**: Provided by aipartnerupflow
   - **Core Executors** (always available):
     - `system_info_executor`: Get system information
     - `command_executor`: Run shell commands
     - `aggregate_results_executor`: Aggregate dependency results
   - **Remote Execution Executors**:
     - `rest_executor`: HTTP/REST API calls (requires `[http]`)
     - `ssh_executor`: Remote command execution via SSH (requires `[ssh]`)
     - `grpc_executor`: gRPC service calls (requires `[grpc]`)
     - `websocket_executor`: Bidirectional WebSocket communication
     - `apflow_api_executor`: Call other aipartnerupflow API instances
     - `mcp_executor`: Model Context Protocol executor (stdio mode: no dependencies, HTTP mode: requires `[a2a]`)
   - **Protocol Servers**:
     - `a2a`: A2A Protocol Server (default)
     - `mcp`: MCP (Model Context Protocol) Server - exposes task orchestration as MCP tools and resources
   - **Container Executors**:
     - `docker_executor`: Containerized command execution (requires `[docker]`)
   - **AI Executors** (optional):
     - `crewai_executor`: LLM-based agents (requires `[crewai]`)
     - `batch_crewai_executor`: Batch execution of multiple crews (requires `[crewai]`)
   - **Generation Executors**:
     - `generate_executor`: Generate task tree JSON arrays from natural language requirements using LLM (requires `openai` or `anthropic` package)

2. **Custom Executors**: You create these
   - API calls
   - Data processing
   - File operations
   - Anything you need!

### Real-World Analogy

Think of executors as specialized workers:
- **Plumber** (executor) knows how to fix pipes (task type)
- **Electrician** (executor) knows how to fix wiring (task type)
- Each worker (executor) has specific skills (code)

### In Code

```python
from aipartnerupflow import BaseTask, executor_register

@executor_register()
class MyCustomExecutor(BaseTask):
    """My custom task executor"""
    
    id = "my_custom_executor"
    name = "My Custom Executor"
    
    async def execute(self, inputs):
        # Your task logic here
        return {"result": "done"}
```

## What is TaskManager?

**TaskManager** is the orchestrator - it manages task execution, dependencies, and priorities. You don't need to worry about the details; it handles everything automatically.

### What TaskManager Does

1. **Checks Dependencies**: Ensures tasks wait for their dependencies
2. **Schedules Execution**: Runs tasks in the right order
3. **Handles Failures**: Manages errors and retries
4. **Tracks Progress**: Monitors task status
5. **Manages Priorities**: Executes high-priority tasks first

### Real-World Analogy

TaskManager is like a project manager:
- Knows what needs to be done (tasks)
- Knows the order (dependencies)
- Assigns work (execution)
- Monitors progress (status tracking)
- Handles problems (error management)

### In Code

```python
# Create TaskManager
task_manager = TaskManager(db)

# Give it a task tree
task_tree = TaskTreeNode(root_task)
task_tree.add_child(TaskTreeNode(child_task))

# TaskManager handles everything automatically
await task_manager.distribute_task_tree(task_tree)
```

## Task Lifecycle

Tasks go through different states during their lifecycle:

```
pending → in_progress → completed
              │
              └──> failed
              │
              └──> cancelled
```

### States Explained

- **pending**: Task is created but not yet executed
- **in_progress**: Task is currently running
- **completed**: Task finished successfully
- **failed**: Task execution failed
- **cancelled**: Task was cancelled before completion

### Visual Flow

```
Create Task → pending
     │
     ▼
Execute Task → in_progress
     │
     ├──> Success → completed
     │
     ├──> Error → failed
     │
     └──> Cancelled → cancelled
```

## Priorities

**Priority** controls execution order when multiple tasks are ready to run. Lower numbers = higher priority.

### Priority Levels

- **0**: Urgent (highest priority)
- **1**: High
- **2**: Normal (default)
- **3**: Low (lowest priority)

### Example

```python
# Urgent task runs first
urgent = await task_repository.create_task(
    name="urgent_task",
    priority=0,  # Executes first
    ...
)

# Normal task runs later
normal = await task_repository.create_task(
    name="normal_task",
    priority=2,  # Executes after urgent
    ...
)
```

## Putting It All Together

Here's how these concepts work together:

```python
# 1. Create TaskManager (the orchestrator)
task_manager = TaskManager(db)

# 2. Create tasks with dependencies
task_a = await task_repository.create_task(
    name="fetch_data",
    priority=1,
    ...
)

task_b = await task_repository.create_task(
    name="process_data",
    parent_id=root.id,  # Organizational: child of root
    dependencies=[{"id": task_a.id}],  # Execution: waits for A
    priority=2,
    ...
)

# 3. Build task tree (organization)
tree = TaskTreeNode(root)
tree.add_child(TaskTreeNode(task_a))
tree.add_child(TaskTreeNode(task_b))

# 4. TaskManager handles execution automatically
# - Checks dependencies
# - Executes in order (A, then B)
# - Tracks status
# - Handles errors
await task_manager.distribute_task_tree(tree)
```

## Key Takeaways

1. **Task**: A unit of work with inputs and results
2. **Task Tree**: Hierarchical organization of tasks
3. **Dependencies**: Control execution order (not parent-child!)
4. **Executor**: The code that runs a task
5. **TaskManager**: Automatically orchestrates everything
6. **Priority**: Controls execution order (lower = higher priority)
